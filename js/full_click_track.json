I see quite a few teachers incorporating the Internet  which they say  stimulates students' interest in writing about a content-area topic that interests them.

The tests showed that reading comprehension scores are consistently low across all grade levels; therefore the major goal of the SIP is to support all students in meeting or exceeding performance standards for literacy. Both reading and writing skills need to addressed if reading scores are to increase.Preliminary Questions from the LIF:1. Do all teachers have training in teaching reading comprehension?2. Can all teachers implement multiple reading strategies?3. How do teachers address different reading levels in their classrooms?4. Are reading skills emphasized in all content areas and grade levels?"
