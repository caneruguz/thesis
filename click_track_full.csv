member of the leadership team at Stromburg High School  in an suburban location.

The tests showed that reading comprehension scores are consistently low across all grade levels; therefore the major goal of the SIP is to support all students in meeting or exceeding performance standards for literacy. Both reading and writing skills need to addressed if reading scores are to increase.Preliminary Questions from the LIF:1. Do all teachers have training in teaching reading comprehension?2. Can all teachers implement multiple reading strategies?3. How do teachers address different reading levels in their classrooms?4. Are reading skills emphasized in all content areas and grade levels?3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,Low,abo_facilities.htm,11/30/08 14:06,NULL3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,Low,abo_facilities_map.htm,11/30/08 14:06,NULL3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,Low,intranet/home.html,11/30/08 14:07,NULL3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,Low,abo_facilities.htm,11/30/08 14:07,NULL3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,Low,stu_demographics.htm,11/30/08 14:07,NULL3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,Low,stu_demographics_clip.htm,11/30/08 14:07,This article was recently printed in the school newspaper.Computer AssistanceWritten by John McNeely3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,High,stu_performance.htm,11/30/08 14:08,English is around 55%(9th Grade). at the first term end of 10th grade scores are about 52%.3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,High,stu_performance.htm,11/30/08 14:24,English is around 55%(9th Grade). at the first term end of 10th grade scores are about 52%.3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,Low,stu_schedule.htm,11/30/08 14:24,NULL3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,Low,stu_leadership.htm,11/30/08 14:30,NULL3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,Low,stu_schedule.htm,11/30/08 14:30,NULL3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,High,stu_performance.htm,11/30/08 14:31,English is around 55%(9th Grade). at the first term end of 10th grade scores are about 52%.3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,Low,sta_demographics.htm,11/30/08 14:32,NULL3912,csstanley@liberty.edu,604,0,232,Low,sta_demographics_talk.htm,11/30/08 14:32,Two members of the Literacy Improvement Focus (LIF) team  ninth grade English teacher  Amy Talbert  and ninth grade science teacher  Trisha Lehman  are overheard talking in Amy's room after school.TRISHA: Do you know where the LIF meeting is being held today?AMY: Yeah  I think it is in Nydia's room.
